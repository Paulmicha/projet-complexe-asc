# Implements hook -s 'asc' -a 'alias' -v 'STACK_VERSION PROVISION_USING'.
#
# Declares default bash aliases for current project instance using drush *with*
# docker compose provisionning. If that's *not* the case, the other
# implementation will be loaded instead :
#
# @see asc/extensions/drush/asc/alias.hook.sh
#
# This file is dynamically included when the "hook" is triggered.
# @see asc/bootstrap.sh
#
# Uses the docker exec interactive flag from 'compose' extension.
# @see asc/extensions/compose/asc/pre_bootstrap.compose.hook.sh
#
# In order to support multi-db projects, those aliases must target the proper
# service depending on the currently selected DB_ID.
#
# This hook will be called once during bootstrap, then once more during "db set"
# where a local variable may be used to overwrite those aliases in order to
# target the correct service.
#
# By default, the target container name will be the DRUSH_SERVICE_NAME value.
#
# @see asc/extensions/drush/asc/global.compose.vars.sh
# @see f_db_set() in asc/extensions/db/db.inc.sh
