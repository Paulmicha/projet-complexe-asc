# [abstract] Gets host-level registry value.

# Reads from an abstract host-level storage by given key.

# This script provides an entry point for triggering a specific hook. "Abstract"
# means that ASC core itself doesn't provide any actual implementation for this
# functionality. In order for this script to have any effect, it is necessary
# to use an extension that does. E.g. :
# @see asc/extensions/file_registry
#
# @example
#   make host-reg-get my_key
#   # Or :
#   asc/host/registry_get.sh my_key
#

. asc/bootstrap.sh
f_host_registry_get "$@"
echo "$reg_val"
