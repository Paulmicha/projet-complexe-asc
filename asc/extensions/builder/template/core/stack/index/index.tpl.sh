#
# This script provides an entry point for triggering a specific hook. "Abstract"
# means that ASC core itself doesn't provide any actual implementation for this
# functionality. In order for this script to have any effect, it is necessary
# to use an extension that does.
#
# To list all the possible paths that can be used among which existing files_arr
# will be sourced when the hook is triggered, run (in this order) :
# $ make hook-debug s:{{ COMPONENT }} a:index v:STACK_VERSION PROVISION_USING INSTANCE_TYPE
#
# @example
#   make {{ COMPONENT }}-{{ SERVICE }}-index
#   # Or :
#   scripts/asc/extend/{{ COMPONENT }}/{{ SERVICE }}_index.sh
#

. asc/bootstrap.sh

hook -p '{{ COMPONENT }}' -s '{{ SERVICE }}' -a 'index' -v 'STACK_VERSION PROVISION_USING INSTANCE_TYPE'
